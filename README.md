# The-Economic-Freedom-Index-Analysis


The "Economic Freedom Index Analysis" project is a comprehensive examination of economic freedom and its associated factors on a global scale. This project is centered around assessing and analyzing various key components that contribute to a nation's overall economic freedom. These components include World Rank, Property Rights, Government Integrity, Tax Burden, Judicial Effectiveness, Fiscal Health, and more.

Our aim is to provide valuable insights into the economic conditions and regulatory environments of different countries, shedding light on the impact of various policy decisions on economic freedom. Through this analysis, we seek to understand the correlation between economic freedom and a nation's prosperity, innovation, and overall well-being.
